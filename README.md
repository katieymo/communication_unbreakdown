# Communication Unbreakdown

Communication Unbreakdown has paired grassroots organizing with cutting-edge data science to help community organizers reach target populations for civic engagement. The solution was used by Peopleâ€™s Action to help them find conflicted voters for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election.

This project was completed for the MIDS W210 Capstone class in Fall 2020.

Team members: Kevin Hartman, Nick Sylva, Daniel Alvarez, and Katie Mo
