# Communication Unbreakdown

Communication Unbreakdown has paired grassroots organizing with cutting-edge data science to help community organizers reach target populations for civic engagement. The solution was used by Peopleâ€™s Action to help them find conflicted voters for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. 

Our solution consisted of three main parts: 
1. defining a process for data processing and flow in an active feedback loop
2. developing DARTS (Dynamic and Responsive Targeting System) software that can dynamically allocate a call list from multiple target pools based on real-time results
3. diverse group of machine-learning models used to identify multiple target pools

Our solution was deployed on October 21st and was used by People's Action in the last two weeks of the 2020 election. With our approach, People's Action was able to have deep and meaningful conversations with 33% more conflicted voters than compared to their previous targeting strategy.

This project was completed for the MIDS W210 Capstone class in Fall 2020.
